Daniel notes

- Good social skills
- Had been to the website
- Seemed pretty interested in Spark

Sudoku question
- He knew the rules for Sudoku
- He described the brute force algorithm pretty well
- Asked if he could assume that the board was the correct size, etc.
- He figured out that he needed to use a Set of numbers, good.
  - Actually used a HashSet, thank you!
  - He added checks that the numbers are between 1 and 9, good

- Finally, someone who just checks every row without getting fancy, ha ha.
- He mentions that he would like to figure out how to optimize the code to not
  check everything so many times and that not doing so "bothers" him, but he
  just went ahead with the brute force (without me having to prompt him too
  much)

- He refactored out some of the common code into a separate function, awesome.
