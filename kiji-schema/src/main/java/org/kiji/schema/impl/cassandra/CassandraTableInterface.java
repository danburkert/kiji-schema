 * The DataStax Java driver has no notion of a pointer to a table object.  Everything instead goes
 * through a Session.  So here we'll instead just keep a pointer to a session and a table name.
 *
 * We may want to get rid of this object eventually.  For now, it just has getters for the
 * CassandraAdmin and table name.

 * This class may be useful for managing how different objects can access tables, what actions they
 * can perform, and for keeping track of references to tables (for figuring out when to close open
 * Cassandra Sessions).
